# Writing Dockerfiles for Go Projects
Create Dockerfiles to containerize Go applications. Use multi-stage builds to keep the image small and the runtime minimal.

## Workflow
1. Start with a generic Go builder image, such as `golang:<version>-alpine`, and use `/app` as the working directory.
2. Copy `go.mod` and `go.sum` first, then run `go mod download` to cache dependencies.
3. Copy the remaining source code after dependencies are ready.
4. Build a static Linux binary with the needed flags, for example:

   ```dockerfile
   RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build \
       -tags musl \
       -ldflags="-w -s -extldflags '-static'" \
       -o /app/app-bin \
       ./cmd/main.go
   ```

5. Use a minimal runtime image such as `alpine:<version>`, install only required packages like `ca-certificates`, and avoid extra tools.
6. Create a non-root user and group, then set the binary ownership and permissions before switching users.
7. Copy only the built binary into the runtime image, expose only the needed port, and set the binary as the entrypoint.


## Rules
- Use multi-stage builds to separate build-time and runtime dependencies.
- Keep version placeholders generic unless the user asks for exact versions.
- Avoid including source files, compilers, package managers, or other unnecessary artifacts in the final image.
- Prefer a static binary and a minimal runtime base image when CGO is not needed.
- Prefer a non-root runtime user when elevated privileges are not required.
